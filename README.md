<p align='center'>A <a href="https://github.com/terror/usernames/blob/master/all.md">list</a> of inactive accounts on github that possess
a `rare` username.</p>

According to GitHub's official Name Squatting Policy:

> GitHub prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be reserved or inactively held for future use. Accounts violating this name squatting policy may be removed or renamed without notice. Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.

So feel free to try and claim what you like!

## Usage

You can run the script with your own custom wordlist (and also tweak the filters).

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT]

arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT,  --input   input file
  -o OUTPUT, --output  output file
```

### Access Token

```
# .env file, replace token_here with your token

TOKEN="token token_here"
```

### Example:

```bash
$ python3 main.py -i users.txt -o output.txt
```
